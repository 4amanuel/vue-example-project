## *Vue Example Project*
### A clean, scalable, optimized starter PWA Vue.js project and tutorial.

Live Demo: https://www.prograhammer.com/vue-example-project

## Installation and Tutorial

The installation and tutorial documentation are contained within the project itself, so visit the docs on the live demo 
here: https://www.prograhammer.com/vue-example-project/#/docs.

Note: All the pages in the docs are set as public and use route hashing, although in your app you will want routes private
and using history mode. See installation guide in the link above for more info.

## Featuring

- **The Latest in Vue.js.** Vue.js 2.4+, Webpack 3.5+, and the official PWA template (we build up from the template).
- **Tutorial.** Walks you through the app to help you fully understand how it's configured and optimized.
- **Client-side.** Static Single-Page App (SPA) so you can take advantage of the more affordable high-traffic
static servers. This project is more focused on the needs  of a private app (accessible via login) where 
your SPA makes API calls to your backend server (Java, Node, PHP, etc.).  
- **Scalable and Optimized.** Discusses and incorporates approaches like named route chunking, 
structuring styles, proxying to your backend API server, working in a production environment, and more.
- **Clean.** Organized structure for growing complexity, parts well covered in tutorial, latest tooling such as Pug/Stylus, and more.
- **Editor Configuration.** Get set up with Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text 3. 
- **Security.** OAuth2, Cookies and CSRF protection.  
- **Community Opinionated.**  Open to PR's, suggestions, questions.
- The featured UI Framework is 
** Buefy/Bulma ** (preferred framework, no jQuery) but instructions are included in the tutorial on 
setting up  
**Twitter Bootstrap 4**
(for developers who are still transitioning away from jQuery).
