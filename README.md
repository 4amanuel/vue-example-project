# ![Important](/src/assets/images/logo-readmee.svg "Vue Example Project")

Live Demo: https://www.prograhammer.com/vue-example-project

The live demo is the same as the project you will install. It contains the tutorial and examples.

## Installation and Tutorial

The installation and tutorial documentation are contained with the project itself, so visit the live demo 
here: https://www.prograhammer.com/vue-example-project/#/docs.

Note: All the pages in the docs are turned as public, although in your app you will want routes/pages private. See the installation
 instructions for further info.

## Featuring

- **The Latest in Vue.js.** Vue.js 2.4+, Webpack 3.5+, and the official PWA template (we build up from the template).
- **Tutorial.** Walks you through the app to help you fully understand how it's configured and optimized.
- **Client-side.** Static Single-Page App (SPA) so you can take advantage of the more affordable high-traffic
static servers. This project is more focused on the needs  of a private app (accessible via login) where 
your SPA makes API calls to your backend server (Java, Node, PHP, etc.).  
- **Scalable and Optimized.** Discusses and incorporates approaches like named route chunking, 
structuring styles, proxying to your backend API server, working in a production environment, and more.
- **Clean.** Organized structure for growing complexity, parts well covered in tutorial, latest tooling such as Pug/Stylus, and more.
- **Editor Configuration.** Get set up with Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text 3. 
- **Security.** OAuth2, Cookies and CSRF protection.  
- **Community Opinionated.**  Open to PR's, suggestions, questions.
- You can choose which UI Framework you want: either 
** Buefy/Bulma on the master branch**
(preferred framework, no jQuery) or 
**Twitter Bootstrap 4 on the bootstrap branch**
(for developers who are still transitioning away from jQuery) with notes how each is configured. See 
[installation](http://www.prograhammer.com/vue-example-project/#/installation) for more info.
