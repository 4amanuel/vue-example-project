          .title.is-4 Component and Page Folder Structure

          .content
            | In some projects you'll see a 
            code /pages
            | folder and a 
            code /components 
            | folder. However, I suggest bringing these together and arranging vertically based on your buisiness domain instead
            | of horizontally by  
            | file type. You don't have to be perfect on your grouping at first, but over time you will adjust as your buisiness 
            | domain will mature. As it matures you will better organize and slice it. You end up with 
            | a project that is easier
            | to split up into separate projects (think microservices?) if you feel the project has become too large
            | and complex. Context switching can also be reduced since related files (related by business/what feature they support)
            | live a little closer to each other.
            | Consider how much nicer it is to keep context in your head looking at a folder like this:

          .title.is-6 Routing independent of buisiness domain/features

          .content
            | This type of structure lives individually from your routing. Your routes (external api) can change
            | seperately from your (internal api) buisiness domain organized in the
            code features/
            | folder.

          .title.is-6 Why are component file names in kebab-case?

          .content 
            | Since some operating systems don't have case-sensitive file naming, the kebab-case is used for 
            | all file names.

          .title.is-4 Configure For Your Site's Root Subfolder

          .content
            | If you are viewing this app via the live demo on Github, you will notice the domain name and subfolder: 
            code https://www.prograhammer.com/vue-example-project
            |  . The "vue-example-project" part of the URL must be configured in a few places. 
            | You'll need to update these places with your own subfolder (or "/" if at the root of your domain name):

            | We also need to simulate the subfolder when we run the dev server. 
            | Unfortunately we can't just update the
