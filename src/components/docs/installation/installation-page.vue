            | This live demo and the app you are about to install 
            strong are the same 
            | . Because this live demo runs on GitHub Pages, you'll need to make a few ajustments first before 
            | you start adding your own work (ie. turn on login and authentication, make routes private, 
            | remove any packages/features you don't want, and so on). Follow the steps below to install and 
            | make the adjustments before you begin. Then you can also read more about deploying 
            | to GitHub Pages in the tutorial if that's something you want for your app.

          .title.is-4 Install

            | (Don't have Node/NPM yet? Thinking about Node 8? See  
            router-link(:to="{ name: 'node'}") this part of the tutorial 
            | first.)

          .title.is-6 Install with Basic Examples

          .content
            | The default install method will not install all the extra examples listed under 
            code Advanced
            |   on the main menu above. This could be more convenient since you don't have to uninstall
            | anything and you can just add what you want:

          .title.is-6 Install with All Examples (Basic + Advanced)

          .content
            | Use the

                npm install   # install dependencies (includes dependencies from the extra examples)

            | To see a list of all the packages

            a(href='#') section of the tutorial
            | . You can remove the ones you don't need. The tutorial also discusses each example in-depth.

          .title.is-4 Before You Begin

          .content
            | Since this app is currently configured to be public and work on GitHub pages, you'll need to adjust 
            | a few things:  

          .title.is-6 Switch to History Mode in VueRouter

          .content
            | Inside the 
            code router/index.js 
            | you need to change the mode from 
            code hash 
            | to 
            code history
            |  so that the router definition looks like this:  

          strong.my-italic src/router/index.js
          pre.block
            code.hljs.javascript
              :highlight(lang='javascript')
                // ...

                /**
                * The Router instance containing all the routes for the application.
                */
                const router = new Router({
                  base: '/example',
                  mode: 'history',   // <-- changed from 'hash'
                  routes: routes.map(route => ({
                    name: route.name,
                    path: route.path,
                    component: route.component,
                    beforeEnter: route.isPublic ? null : guardRoute
                  }))
                })

          .content
            | The reason for this is because we cannot manipulate GitHub's server rewrite rules, so 
            | every route needs to be a hash to ensure the 
            code index.html
            |  is hit. 

          .title.is-6 Make All The Routes Private (Except Login Page)

          .content
            | For this live demo, I needed pages to be public so no one has to log in to see them. However,
            | the pages in your app will be private. Open up the 
            code routes.js 
            | file and update all the routes to be 
            code isPublic: false
            | except of course the 
            code login page
            |.

                * Every route becomes a chunk, loaded only when used.
                * Reduces size of initial App load.
                */

                  {

            | . You should see the login screen. 

          .content Now start reading through the tutorial. It will guide you specifically on how a PWA works (how you 
            | add it to homescreen, what you can adjust, caveats, and so on). Happy coding!
